# Carbon Calculator

Welcome do Carbon Calculator!
This project has two modules: the backend (server folder) and the frontend (client folder).
You can learn more about each one in their respective README.md files.

## Things I'd like to improve

* Write some tests for the frontend, or at least add a Storybook
* Evolve this repository to a monorepo, this way both backend and frontend would automatically run
* Add a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the app to a cloud provider
* Add Linters to the frontend and backend, and fix all the warnings
